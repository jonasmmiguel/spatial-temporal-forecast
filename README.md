# Spatial-Temporal-Forecast
Some baseline model of Spatial-Temporal Forecasting.

 ## Models
 
  * T-GCN

PyTorch implementation of the spatio-temporal graph convolutional network proposed in [T-GCN: A Temporal Graph Convolutional Network for Traffic Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05320) by Ling Zhao, Yujiao Song, Chao Zhang, Yu Liu, Pu Wang, Tao Lin, Min Deng, Haifeng Li. 

  * STGCN

Pytorch version of stgcn proposed in [Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks: A Deep Learning Framework for Traffic Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04875) by Bing Yu, Haoteng Yin, Zhanxing Zhu.
This version was implemented by [https://github.com/FelixOpolka/STGCN-PyTorch](https://github.com/FelixOpolka/STGCN-PyTorch)
  
 ## Requirements
